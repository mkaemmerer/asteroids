Asteroids
=========

The classic arcade game, written using functional reactive programming.


Building the game
=================

Asteroids uses npm and bower to manage dependencies, and gulp to build the application.

To completely build the game from scratch, first install dependencies by running
```shell
>  npm install && bower install
```

Then you can build the game by running
```
>  gulp build
```
